Project Description: Automated File Synchronization System

Overview
The Automated File Synchronization System is a robust solution designed to streamline file management and synchronization across multiple devices within a team. This project utilizes a Python script in conjunction with a batch file to automatically download newly added files from a server to respective devices, ensuring that all team members have access to the latest versions of important documents.

Features
Automated File Download: Automatically detects and downloads new files added to the server.
Real-time Synchronization: Ensures all team members have the most up-to-date files without manual intervention.
Cross-Device Compatibility: Supports synchronization across various devices and operating systems.
Efficient File Management: Reduces the risk of outdated files and enhances collaboration by providing a centralized file management system.

How It Works
Server Monitoring: The Python script continuously monitors the server for any new files added by team members.
File Detection: When a new file is detected, the script triggers a batch file to start the download process.
Automatic Download: The batch file facilitates the automatic downloading of the new file to the designated devices.
Synchronization: The downloaded files are synchronized across all devices, ensuring every team member has the latest version.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on the system.
Batch file script compatible with the operating system.
Network access to the server where files are stored.
